    <h3><strong><b>Knowing how to inject insulin is a primary skill to
        acquire for a child living with diabetes. This poster
        shows the step-by-step method for injection. In
        addition, the poster provides the opportunity for
        you to address some of the key issues associated
        with being diagnosed with diabetes</b></strong></h3>
        <h4>Key messages for the child:</h4>
        <li><strong>Your body cannot make insulin and therefore
            you need to inject it.</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Injecting insulin is necessary for you to be
                healthy and will become part of your daily
                routine for the rest of your life</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>You need to inject your insulin at certain times
                    of the day and in relation to when you take
                    your meals.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>There are a few easy steps to follow for
                        injecting your insulin - learn them - they are
                        shown on this poster and on the handout you
                        will receive.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>You need to use a syringe (and needle) to inject
                            your insulin. Do not use the syringe more than
                            once. Remember to throw the syringe away
                            in a safe place (for example a jar with a lid) to
                            ensure that you or another person do not get
                            hurt on the sharp needle.
                            </strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Your insulin is a very important part of your
                                wellbeing. Insulin needs to be stored correctly.
                                Keep your insulin in a cool place like a
                                refrigerator (not the freezer). If you do not have
                                a refrigerator at home there are other ways to
                                store your insulin. I will show you how.</strong></li>

    <h3><strong><b>This dialogue poster is intended as an aid to
        talking about how insulin works in the body, and
        to make the child understand why he/she needs
        insulin.</b></strong></h3>
        <h3><strong><b>The poster shows a highly simplified presentation
            of a very complex process. The poster aims to
            ensure that insulin is understood by the child and
            the family/caregiver as being natural and necessary
            for the body to work. That insulin is a friend, even
            if the thought of injecting it every day may be
            overwhelming. </b></strong></h3>
            <h4>Key messages for the child:</h4>
            <li><strong>You must inject the right amount of insulin.

                <li><strong>Sometimes you will need to adjust the amount
                    of insulin you take. At first this will be difficult
                    to work out, but you will learn and get much
                    better at it with time.</strong></li>

                        <li><strong>Later you and your child will learn to use a
                            glucometer to measure blood sugar levels
                            this will help you judge how much insulin is

<a name="name4"><h2><b>Poster 4: Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and how to recognise it</b></h2></a>
    <img src="4.jpg" alt="this is 1stimg" class="img1">
    <h3><strong>Learning to recognise low blood sugar is one of
        the most critical lessons a child with diabetes can
        learn. Particularly when the child is not living close
        to a diabetes clinic.</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>Poster 4 uses the term low blood sugar rather than
            hypoglycaemia, because it is easier to understand.
            At a later stage the child should learn the proper
            term, but at the very beginning, it is important to
            explain diabetes using simple terms and concepts.</strong></h3>
            <h3><strong>For many children in the CDiC programme, the
                risk of dying from an unrecognised hypoglycaemic
                episode is relatively high, as many live long
                distances from a clinic.</strong></h3>
                <h3><strong>For this reason it is critical that the children and
                    their family/caregivers understand the symptoms of
                    hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). It is suggested
                    that quite a lot of time is devoted to the signs and
                    symptoms of a hypoglycaemic episode, and that
                    the messages are repeated at each visit. Also, stress
                    that if they are in any doubt, they should use the
                    glucometer.</strong></h3>
                    <h4>Key messages for the child:</h4>
                    <li><strong>Low-blood sugar can get very serious if left
                        untreated. It is important that you learn to

    <h3><strong>Poster 5 explains the relationship between insulin,
        blood sugar levels, food and physical activity that
        causes the child to experience low blood sugar</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>The main purpose of this poster is to establish an
            understanding of how these factors affect each
            other.</strong></h3>
            <h4>Key messages for the child:</h4>
            <li><strong>Your blood sugar levels are affected by things
                like physical activity, food and insulin.</strong></li>
                <li><strong> Low blood sugar happens when the level of
                    sugar in your blood drops too low to give your
                    body energy.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong> Too much insulin at once, or an extra injection of insulin, can cause your blood sugar level to
                        drop and give you low blood sugar
                        
                    </strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Physical activity lowers the amount of insulin
                        your body needs to keep the blood sugar levels
                        steady. This means that higher levels of physical
                        activity than normal without adjusting your
                        insulin dose can cause your blood sugar level to
                        drop.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The balance between food and insulin is the
                            key to good diabetes control, and if you have
                            more or less of the one, you must adjust the

    <h3><strong>Besides discussing food groups it is very important
        to discuss quantities – particularly of starches,

                If you do not wash your hands the glucometer
                can give you an incorrect number.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The index finger is not always the best finger to
                    use, because the small hole made by the lancet
                    will heal slower, as this finger is used a lot.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Do not use the same spot twice in a row to
                        draw blood - let the last hole heal before using
                        the same spot again.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>It is important for you to take care of your feet.
                Not doing so can lead to complications</strong></li>
                <li><strong>You should follow the steps in poster 16 for
                    taking care of your feet and ask your nurse to
                    help you check your feet when you visit the
                    clinic</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>It is important for you to keep your feet
                        protected by wearing sandals or shoes.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong> It is also important for you to be active. Being
                            active helps your body stay healthy and fit by
                            ensuring that blood and oxygen are circulated
                            to all parts of your body, including your feet.</strong></li>

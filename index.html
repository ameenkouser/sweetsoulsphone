        Type 1 diabetes (T1D), formerly known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that originates when cells that make insulin (beta cells) are destroyed by the immune system. Insulin is a hormone required for the cells to use blood sugar for energy and it helps regulate glucose levels in the bloodstream.The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the level of sugar or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in the blood.People of all ages can develop type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn't make insulin or makes very little insulin. Insulin helps blood sugar enter the cells in your body for use as energy. Without insulin, blood sugar can't get into cells and builds up in the bloodstream.</h3></p>

Some people are genetically more at risk than others.Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, psychological stress, and urbanization

Several other non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due to Candida infection. About half of affected individuals may also be asymptomatic. Type 1 presents abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain asymptomatic for many years.

    <h1>Why do I need Insulin ?..</h1>
    <video src="video1.mp4" alt="video" width="360px" controls loop muted ></video>
    <p><strong>Insulin is a hormone that helps your body turn food into energy and control blood sugar levels. People with diabetes may need insulin because their bodies can't make enough insulin or can't use it properly. Insulin helps manage blood sugar levels and prevents serious health problems.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Insulin is essential for survival in people with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes may need insulin if their blood sugar levels are not well managed with oral medication.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Push the plunger relatively slowly to inject the dose. After the dose has been injected, hold the needle in for a good 10 seconds to help insulin get delivered and prevent any of the dose escaping out. Ensure that the used needle bin is deposited into a sharps bin.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Generally, to correct a high blood sugar, one unit of insulin is needed to drop the blood glucose by 50 mg/dl. This drop in blood sugar can range from 30-100 mg/dl or more, depending on individual insulin sensitivities, and other circumstances.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Hypoglycemia can happen when your blood sugar drops below 4mmol/L. It needs to be treated quickly.
        You can test yourself for hypoglycemia at home. You can check to see if your diabetes medication raises your risk of hypoglycemia or to see if the symptoms you are experiencing are due to low blood sugar.</strong></p>
